          # Attestations
          # SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) and provenance attestations improve security and traceability, ensuring your images meet modern software supply chain requirements.
          # With a small amount of additional configuration, you can configure docker/build-push-action to generate Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and provenance attestations for the image, at build-time.
          # To generate this additional metadata, you need to make two changes to your workflow:
          # Before the build step, add a step that uses docker/setup-buildx-action. This action configures your Docker build client with additional capabilities that the default client doesn't support.
          # Then, update the Build and push Docker image step to also enable SBOM and provenance attestations.
